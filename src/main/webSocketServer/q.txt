What should the WebSocketHandler @OnWebSocket things do?

What connects the facade and the handler?

Whats up with the game services listed? Where should they go? I'm not really sure what other methods from previous phases its referring to

Ik http connections can be upgraded to ws connections, are we doing that here?
AKA do I need to edit my http server class at all, or will I just start using the WS stuff when I do game specific things?

Kind of confused on the client WS stuff
- Whats the endpoint?
- What is the messageHandler.whole?
- How does the Client's WSFacade connect to the Server's WSHandler?
- What is the GameHandler interface for? So sorry, just really want to understand whats going on...

Once all this stuff is done and tested, I'll just drop the facade into the client stuff and go from there?
I guess the WS is accessing the DB so it needs to interact with the server somewhere...
