What do the handlers do?

- If the web API requires an auth token, the handler can validate the auth token
- Might put this logic in a handler base class so it can be shared by multiple handlers or in a Service class that can be shared by multiple services
- Deserialize JSON request body to Java request object
- Call service class to perform the requested function, passing it the Java request object
- Receive Java response object from service
- Serialize Java response object to JSON
- Send HTTP response back to client with appropriate status code and response body
